# Barebones TS CLI + Scripting Template
This code is intended to be used as a template for quickly setting up a new project for simple scripts or coding challenges with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It makes use of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and is inspired by the [Minimal TS Node Project by Jimmy Hogoboom]( https://gist.github.com/jimmyhogoboom/569a4e4f83c12396e698bbba43b19ce0 ).

## To Use
1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/Dilden/ts-template) or download the ZIP. Just get the code on your machine somehow.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Write your tests in `index.test.ts`
4. Write your code in `index.ts`
5. Run the tests with `npm test`
5. Run the code as CLI with `npm run it`
